 Hello,

 How are you?  Kindly pardon me for not informing you about my urgent
 trip to Edinburg for three days Seminar. It was something urgent and i
 didn't even inform anyone about this traveling. I need your help
 urgently because I got my wallet misplaced on my way to the hotel I
 lodged in after the Seminar yesterday which was actually the last day.
 My money,phone, cards,diary, including my return ticket and other
 vital documents are all in the wallet. I'm stranded here as i  can not
 even make public calls, i only have access to the internet and that is
 why i'm sending you this email so that you could help me out with
 $2000 to pay for my bills and to sort myself out. But I will
 appreciate any amount you could afford. I will pay you back upon my
 arrival. I don't even mind paying with interest.

 If you would help me with any amount, i will advise you go straight to
 any western union money transfer outlet or any nearby bank and ask of
 western union money transfer. You only need my name and the address
 below to make the transfer at the western union office.  After the
 transfer at the western union, you can just send me the money transfer
 control number[MTCN]. Which is the ten digits number [MTCN], I will be
 able to get the money here immediately.

 Address: 80 High Street,The Royal Mile,EH1 1TH, Edinburgh,United Kingdom

 Looking forward to hearing from you soon
 Regards.
